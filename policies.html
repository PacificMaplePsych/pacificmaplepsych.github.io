          <div class="policy-label">Referrals</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Self-referrals are welcomed. You do not need a medical referral from your general physician for psychological services.
              <br/><br/>A referral is required to obtain psychiatric services with Pacific Maple Psych Centre. This referral can come from either a general physician or from a psychologist in our practice. Only clients who are actively seeking a psychologist at least biweekly for 6 weeks prior to referral are eligible for internal referral to psychiatry services.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-label">Student<br/>Therapy</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Student therapy sessions are offered at $120 per session. For every 4 sessions, the students get one hour of supervision from a fully licensed Ph.D. or Psy.D. registered psychologist. Provided the student is being regularly supervised, most insurance providers cover this cost. Please do confirm this with your provider beforehand.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              This opportunity is also granted to clients who encounter financial difficulties which preclude them from receiving therapy and psychological support for their presenting issues. The psychology student offers both in-person and teletherapy sessions supervised by a fully licensed Ph.D. or Psy.D. registered psychologist, and your therapeutic needs would be receiving attention from both a student and an experienced professional. This is a wonderful opportunity to receive support at a much lower cost.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-label">Insurance</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Check with your insurance provider to determine what coverage you have for the services provided by a Registered Psychologist in British Columbia. If any of these fees are not covered by your insurance or if you happen to be without health coverage, note that these psychological services are tax deductible and they qualify as a medical expense.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-label">Cancellation<br/>Policy</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Note that a 48-hour cancellation policy is in place at all times. If you cancel within 48 hours, you will incur a $75 fee for each cancellation. If you cancel within 24 hours, the full cost of the missed session is owed. The only exception is if there is an emergency with associated documentation to prove the emergency; in that case, the fee may be waived on compassionate grounds, only upon disclosure of evidentiary documentation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-label">Payment<br/>Methods</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Fees are expected to be paid in full at the beginning of each appointment unless alternate third-party arrangements have been made prior to the session. Payment is primarily by credit card. If you prefer to pay by e-transfer, there is a $5 discount, however e-transfer is only an acceptable option if received by our bank before an appointment begins. A credit card must be on file prior to the appointment, and the credit card will automatically be charged if the e-transfer is not received within the first 5 minutes of the appointment.

              Cost of sessions will be discussed directly. Every transaction will be accompanied with an invoice capturing the date of service.

          <div class="policy-label">Crime Victim<br/>Assistance<br/>Program (CVAP)</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Select members of our practice are registered with CVAP, a government funded program, which covers a portion of the full fee to help with the healing process associated with traumatic experiences.

          <div class="policy-label">B.C.<br/>Emergency<br/>Health<br/>Services<br/>(BCEHS)</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Pacific Maple Psych Centre is honoured to partner with B.C. Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) in offering tailored psychological support for first responders. Through this collaboration, BCEHS employees, along with their spouses and dependents, gain access to crucial services at no cost. The Employee & Family Assistance Program (EFAP) provides free, short-term, solution-focused counseling, adept at addressing a wide range of life situations. Furthermore, the Critical Incident Stress program ensures immediate access to a network of trauma-trained professionals, specifically attuned to the demands of first responders.

          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              If you are experiencing an emergency or crisis of a medical, mental health, or trauma-related nature, immediately call 911 or the B.C. suicide prevention phone-line at 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433). You may also go to the nearest hospital emergency room to seek immediate support.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-label">E-mail</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              In order to ensure full confidentiality and a secure transmission of information between therapist and client, it is necessary that you refrain from e-mailing content related to your therapy sessions. However, should you choose to communicate via e-mail, we provide an encrypted e-mail which you will be given during your time in our care.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              It is necessary to be cognizant of the fact that all e-mails are retained in the internet service provider's logs, and as result, are subject to possible mismanagement. While it is unlikely that somebody will be looking at these logs, they might theoretically be read by ISP's internet service administrators. You should also know that any e-mails or communication that we receive from you, as well as any responses that we send to you, are a part of your legal record.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-label">Teletherapy<br/>Sessions</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Teletherapy allows continuity of service when in-person sessions might not be an option due to sickness, transportation limitations, vacations, or conflicting schedules. For those who live remotely, and who also appreciate receiving therapy in the comfort and privacy of their own home or office, this proves to be an ideal solution. The use of internet voice and video conversation is a secure form of communication that is encrypted for the purpose of protecting and safeguarding your privacy. Note that cell phones offer the least amount of protection, while landlines continue to be a more secure mode of connection. Granted, with any method of communication, there is a possibility that privacy and therefore confidentiality might be breached.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-label">Code of<br/>Conduct</div>
          <div class="policy-body">
            <p class="p-body">
              Members of our practice are bound by the codes of conduct, ethical standards, and professionalism expectations of their respective regulatory bodies and/or professional associations. We respect the privacy and autonomy of our clinicians outside of work and do not monitor, police, or intrude upon lawful off-duty conduct. Our focus is on ensuring that care is delivered safely, competently, compassionately, and professionally during active work hours. We do not monitor personal conduct, provided it does not involve criminal activity and does not affect their ability to practise while in an active work environment.
<br/><br/>However, we do not tolerate derogatory, mocking, or dehumanizing commentary about clients (“locker room talk”) at any time, regardless of the challenges a client may present. Members of our practice are expected to maintain compassion, respect, and clinical professionalism at all times, even in moments of frustration or clinical complexity. If any clinicians find their ability to maintain empathy for particular clients has diminished, they may wish to debrief with colleagues to assist in reconnecting with the required attitude of unconditional positive regard for all clients. Alternatively and only in extreme cases, they may transfer the care of the client to another clinician.
