                Student therapy sessions are offered at $120 per session. For every 4 sessions, the students get one hour of supervision from Mickey Stein, Ph.D. Most insurance providers cover this cost, as long as the student is being supervised by a registered psychologist in Vancouver. Please do confirm this with your provider beforehand.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                This opportunity is also granted to clients who encounter financial difficulties which preclude them from receiving therapy and psychological support for their presenting issues. The psychology student offers both in-person and teletherapy sessions supervised by Mickey Stein, Ph.D., and your therapeutic needs would be receiving both of our attention. This is a wonderful opportunity to receive support at a much lower cost.

                Check with your insurance provider to determine what coverage you have for the services provided by a Registered Psychologist in British Columbia. If any of these fees are not covered by your insurance or if you happen to be without health coverage, note that these psychological services are tax deductible and they qualify as a medical expense.

If you cancel within 24 hours, the full cost of the missed session is payable. The only exception is if there is an emergency with associated documentation to prove the emergency; in that case, the fee may be waived on compassionate grounds, only upon disclosure of evidentiary documentation.

                Fees are expected to be paid in full at the beginning of each appointment unless alternate third-party arrangements have been made prior to the session. Payment is primarily by credit card. If you prefer to pay by e-transfer, there is a $5 discount, however e-transfer is only an acceptable option if received by our bank before an appointment begins. A credit card must be on file prior to the appointment, and the credit card will automatically be charged if the e-transfer is not received within the first 5 minutes of the appointment.

                In order to ensure full confidentiality and a secure transmission of information between therapist and client, it is necessary that you refrain from e-mailing content related to your therapy sessions. However, should you choose to communicate via e-mail, we provide an encrypted e-mail which you will be given during your time in our care.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                It is necessary to be cognizant of the fact that all e-mails are retained in the internet service provider's logs, and as result, are subject to possible mismanagement. While it is unlikely that somebody will be looking at these logs, they might theoretically be read by ISP's internet service administrators. You should also know that any e-mails or communication that we receive from you, as well as any responses that we send to you, are a part of your legal record.

                Teletherapy allows continuity of service when in-person sessions might not be an option due to sickness, transportation limitations, vacations, or conflicting schedules. For those who live remotely, and who also appreciate receiving therapy in the comfort and privacy of their own home or office, this proves to be an ideal solution. The use of internet voice and video conversation is a secure form of communication that is encrypted for the purpose of protecting and safeguarding your privacy. Note that cell phones offer the least amount of protection, while landlines continue to be a more secure mode of connection. Granted, with any method of communication, there is a possibility that privacy and therefore confidentiality might be breached.
